# Design Patterns
## What are Design Patterns?
**Design Patterns** are reusable solutions to the problems that as a developer we encounter in our day to day programming.
**Design patterns** are good solutions to common problems in software development.

## Types of Design Patterns
Gang of Four categorized the Design Pattern into three main categories based on the three problem area of software architecture. They are as follows.
1.  [**Creational Design Pattern**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/creational-design-pattern/)
2.  [**Structural Design Pattern**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/structural-design-pattern/)
3.  [**Behavioral Design Pattern**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/behavioral-design-pattern/)

> **What's the difference between design patterns and design principles?**
> While design patterns give you code implementation for typical problems we face in development, design principles help you select the best options when it comes to implementing the software architecture.

## Creational design patterns
There are five creational design patterns:
**Singleton**: The singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of an object will exist at the application level.
**Factory method**: A factory pattern is used to create objects without using the  class to be used.
**Abstract factory**: Without the specification of their concrete classes, groups of related or dependent objects are instantiated by the abstract factory.
**Prototype**: Specifies the type of prototype to create, and then creates copies of the prototype.
**Builder**: Separates object construction from its representation.
